          <p>Paw Rescue is the first ever Animal Shelter, which is helping the paralyzed, mentally disables, abandoned dogs. We are providing them shelter home, food, necessary medical care and love.
It started a long ago with a very small incidents, which was happened since I was 12 years old.In winter season someone left a small child of around 15,20 days at road and we saw him shivering and struggling.We took him home and named Puppy. It was our first adoption, which lead us to the reason for inner peace while helping kind of the stray dogs around us. 
in coming years count of dogs at my home has reached more then 30. Inspiration to start an NGO was caminto mind during the COVID lockdown tenure, when animals were struggling for food and basic needs. We received a special pass from Government to move around the city and to help these speechlesssouls. During the time government has appreciated our effort and help us providing a space where we can take care of every need for these babies 
and help them on a large scale. </p>
